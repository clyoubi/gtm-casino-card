# GTM Casino Card
This plugin provides a custom shortcode that displays detailed information about a casino in a predefined, visually styled card format. </br>
Each casino card is dynamically rendered with a shortcode based on a unique identifier, making it easy for content editors to insert specific casino profiles anywhere across the site.</br>
The plugin is designed for flexibility, seamless integration, and ease of use within the WordPress block editor or classic editor.

## üöÄ Installation

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Log into WordPress Admin
Go to `https://yourdomain.com/wp-admin` and log in with your credentials. (if your website has a different admin panel slug to login, please contact your super administrator)

#### 2. Navigate to the Plugin Upload Page
From the left sidebar, go to:  
**Plugins > Add New**

#### 3. Upload the Plugin ZIP
- Click the **‚ÄúUpload Plugin‚Äù** button at the top.
- Click **‚ÄúChoose File‚Äù** and select the plugin ZIP file **gtm-casino-card.zip**.
- Click **‚ÄúInstall Now‚Äù**

#### 4. Activate the Plugin
Once the plugin has been successfully installed, click **‚ÄúActivate Plugin‚Äù**

**The app will unistall itself if it detect a clash with another plugin using the same shortcode name id to avoid mismatches.**

## üõ† Troubleshooting

- **"The link you followed has expired"**  
  ‚Üí Increase `upload_max_filesize` and `post_max_size` in your `php.ini` or `.htaccess` file.

- **Installation Fails**  
  ‚Üí Make sure your ZIP archive contains the plugin files inside a properly named root folder (not just raw `.php` files at the top level).

### Test connection
When the API credentials are set, you can test the connection to ensure they are correct.
Casino Card -> Settings -> Test Connection


### üß† Cache
To optimize performance and reduce redundant API requests, the plugin supports caching via WordPress Transients.

* **Enable Cache:** You can enable or disable the cache from the plugin settings (Enable Cache checkbox).
* **Cache Duration:** Set the duration (in hours) for which API responses should be cached. After expiration, fresh data will be fetched.
* **Manual Clear:** A button in the settings page allows you to manually clear the cache if needed.
* **Automated Clearing:** The plugin uses WordPress Cron to automatically clear cached data based on the duration you set.

#### Custom Currencies
You can define which currency symbol should be used when displaying monetary values.

* Available Options: EUR (‚Ç¨), USD ($) by default.
* Setting Location: Under General Settings, use the Currency For Bonus dropdown.
* Extendability: Developers can extend supported currencies by modifying the Casino::$currencies `public static $currencies = ['EUR' => '‚Ç¨', 'USD' => '$'];` variable in Casino class.


## ‚ö°Ô∏è Impact Analysis

### ‚úÖ Performance
Remote API Fetching: When the `[casino_card]` shortcode is rendered without caching, it triggers a real-time API request to an external server. This:
* Adds latency depending on the response time of the third-party API.
* Can delay server-side rendering of the page.


#### Data Fetching
The plugin fetches casino data from a remote REST API via `wp_remote_get()`. Without caching, repeated shortcodes on the same or different pages could result in multiple API calls per request.

To mitigate this, transient caching is implemented:

* Each unique casino ID generates a separate cache key.
* Cached data is reused during the defined time window (casino_cache_delay in hours).
* Cache can be purged manually or via a WordPress cron job.
* logo images are load with async to not impact the TTFb

#### Resource Usage
Minimal impact on CPU and memory due to use of native PHP functions and WordPress APIs.
* Only necessary assets (style.css) are enqueued conditionally if the `[casino_card]` shortcode is detected in the content.
* Object-oriented PHP usage improves code modularity and clarity without performance penalty.

#### Recommendations
* Ensure API caching is enabled `(casino_general_enable_cache = yes)` in high-traffic environments.
* Avoid overusing shortcodes in high-density areas (e.g., listing dozens of casinos on a single page).

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Plugin Conflict
#### Shortcode Naming
* The plugin registers the  `[casino_card]` shortcode and verifies its availability before registration.
* If another plugin or theme has already registered the shortcode, this plugin:
* Automatically deactivates itself
* Displays an admin notice to prevent unexpected behavior

#### Settings Page & Menu Slugs
* Admin menu uses unique slugs (gtm-casino-card, casino_card_settings) to avoid collisions.
* Custom settings are namespaced using casino_ and gtm_ prefixes.

#### Recommendations
* Avoid installing other plugins that use the same  `[casino_card]` shortcode or access the same API endpoint namespace.
* Perform QA testing when new plugins are added, especially those involving custom shortcodes or external API calls.

### üîí Security
#### API Authentication
* Uses HTTP Basic Auth for communication with the external casino data API.
* Credentials (username, password) are stored securely using WordPress options API and not exposed in the frontend.

#### Data Sanitization & Validation
* All settings are escaped using `esc_attr()`, `esc_html()`, and validated with WordPress sanitizers.
* JSON responses are parsed and validated before display.
* Inputs from shortcodes are filtered via `shortcode_atts()` to prevent arbitrary parameter injection.

#### Transients & Cleanup
* All transient keys are prefixed and tracked to prevent persistent bloat.
* Admin button and scheduled cron allow cache cleanup, reducing attack surface through stale data exposure.

#### Access Control
* Only users with manage_options capability (typically Admins) can change settings or view sensitive config.
* Shortcode execution does not expose internal settings or secrets.
